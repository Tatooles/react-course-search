Topics reviewed include reading/writing data and objects from/to files and exception handling, and command line arguments. Topics introduced: object-oriented design; class vs. object; create and define interfaces and iterators; searching and sorting; abstract data types (List,Stack,Queue,PriorityQueue(Heap),Binary Search Tree); generic interfaces (parametric polymorphism); how to design and write test methods and classes; array based vs. linked node implementations; introduction to complexity analysis; recursion.",

This course introduces balanced search trees, graphs, graph traversal algorithms, hash tables and sets, and complexity analysis and about classes of problems that require each data type. Students are required to design and implement using high quality professional code, a medium sized program, that demonstrates knowledge and use of latest language features, tools, and conventions. Additional topics introduced will include as needed for projects: inheritance and polymorphism; anonymous inner classes, lambda functions, performance analysis to discover and optimize critical code blocks. Students learn about industry standards for code development. Students will design and implement a medium size project with a more advanced user-interface design, such as a web or mobile application with a GUI and event- driven implementation; use of version-control software.",

      "description": "Focuses on the role that psychological principles, research evidence and social science play in the laws of U.S. society, especially in the policies and mechanisms of social control of human behavior. The course will address the ways that society defines membership, and the role of psychology in how it determines who should be excluded or restricted from open society, in order to maintain a more civil society. In addition to learning the factual information about how selected processes work in the legal and social context, students will be asked to consider the role they can play as citizens in supporting or changing these social processes. The course will take a particular interest in psycholegal issues \"in action\" and in learning about the clinical-legal processes used to determine the disposition of individuals considered marginal in society. Finally, the course will address the mechanisms that are used to exclude individuals from open society through criminal and civil court processes, the role of psychology as a science, and the role of psychologists as behavioral experts in criminal and civil courts, and in shaping social policies.",
